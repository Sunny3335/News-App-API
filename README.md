# Overview
Free News API is able to fetch local news and category news in real time.
An API-based news web application is a digital platform that aggregates and displays news articles, headlines, and information from various sources using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). These applications provide users with easy access to a wide range of news content, allowing them to stay informed about current events, topics of interest, and breaking news.
